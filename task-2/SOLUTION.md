First I created the directory using mkdir command and then name of the directory which was Coordinates-Location .
after that inside that directory I created another directory named Nort with same command.
after that i created a file using command nano <filename.txt>
then i found the value of discriminant and used ctrl + shift + u B 0 and then released all the keys to get the degree symbol.
again created another 2 files with same command .
after that i made a file with nano command and combined all the three file using cat command.
cat file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt > file4.txt 
after using this command the entire values stored in file 1 2 and 3 will be in the 4th one.
the same command continued till step5.

commands used:

mkdir <nameodthedirectory>
nano <filename>
ls *.txt to view the files in the directory.
cat EDegree.txt EMinutes.txt ESeconds.txt > EastCoordinate.txt

## My Approach To Tasks

All the tasks by amfoss was intresting , some of them took time for me,.



task 0 is dual boot ubntu which i followed some tutorials and completed.


task 1 was about introduction to github which was an easy one so no isuues faced in that.


In task -2 i got confused with some commands and all but yeah again it was also easy task and in the end of this i learned about commands such as mkdir nano etc.

Task-3  I tried doing it but didnt got the correct code.

Task-5 I tried task -5 and got till line 50 but was not able to complete the entire programm.

task-6 this task took alot of time for me got confused at many places  had issue with emulator at first my phone didnt had the developer option but after that used another phone and got it,then had issue with pubspec.yaml file aswell but it was solved later. i got all the pages dscription heading and also the dotted animation , but then animation was somewhat different and also got the skip and get started button in a different way.

task-8 task 8 was about JSExplorer it took me 3 days to complete the task but after doing the task i realised it was not that tough . I got stuck in the second page with button but after i got one button then i got almost evry button except button 1 and 6 which again took some time but after watching many tutorials and referring to various website about the issue got that.and page 3 it was easy . so yeah successfully completed task 8.

task-9 task 9 was again somewhat easy for me added the blog aswell .

task-10 task 10 i finished lec 0 and tried out the scratch thing but didnt completed.

task-11 task 11 was intresting as i love making posters i used canva for this.

task-12 I went through the refrence provided by amfoss and also watched some tutorials and completed the task.I didnt faced mush issue solving this task.

task-14 this task was intresting aswell as somewhat tricky for me but watched the tutorials and learned the use of each command .


I was not able to do the tasks for somedays because of college assignments . and I have also contributed for hacktoberfest my 4 pr got accepted and waiting for the tshirts ....
I have contibuted 6-7 hours for the amfoss tasks in most of the days.
